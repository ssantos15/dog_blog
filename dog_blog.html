    <p>If you missed out on my tips of keeping your dog happy from last weeks <a href="file:///C:/Users/Steve/Desktop/EpicodusProgrammingPractice/week1/monday/favorite_things/favorite_things.html">blog</a>, make sure to tune in to my blog today.  Today I will give you more tips on how to <strong>keep your dog happy</strong> from using examples with my dog.  My dog, Coco has always been a sad one, but I've found ways to bond with him by taking him to the park, feeding him, and playing with him. I've also let him sleep in my room and listen music with him.  Dogs love it when you can just sit down and listen to music with them, it builds that alone time relationship with just you and your dog while doing <em>absolutley nothing.</em></p>
    <p>Another thing to do with your dog is to take him out to dog parks, they love it when they can socialize with other animals when you're around. A list of dog parks will be shown below.

        <li><a href= "http://www.seattle.gov/parks/find/parks/plymouth-pillars-park">Plymouth Pillar Parks</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.seattle.gov/parks/find/parks/regrade-park">Regrade Park<a/></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.seattle.gov/parks/find/parks/blue-dog-pond">Blue Dog Pond</a></li>

    <p>If your dog makes friends, you will then be able to sign him up for <em><a href="http://www.gloriadeistpaul.org/highlands-doggie-play-dates/">play dates</a></em> in the future. Not only will your dog make friends but you can make a friend also.
