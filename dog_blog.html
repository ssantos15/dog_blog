          <p>When Coco was  newborn puppy, he didn't bother his mom for milk. He would always go straight to the food. Unfortunatley he couldn't chew since he had no teeth so eventually he'd give up and go back to his mothers.</p>

          <p>When Cocoa was about a year old, he became super active. He love playing with every dog he saw and never stopped.  His hyperness was insane, eventually he found himself sound asleep by the evening, but once morning rolled around. It was constant play again.</p>

          <img src="img/puppy.jpg" alt="An image of Cocoa playing with a puppy" style="width:100%;height:375px;">
          <p>As Coco got older, his hyperness eventually wore off.  He was more of a friendly young dog.  He would play with the puppies the same way older dogs would play with him as a puppy. He cared for them and overall was a good dog.</p>

          <p>If you missed out on my tips of keeping your dog happy from last weeks <a href="file:///C:/Users/Steve/Desktop/EpicodusProgrammingPractice/week1/monday/favorite_things/favorite_things.html">blog</a>, make sure to tune in to my blog today.  Today I will give you more tips on how to <strong>keep your dog happy</strong> from using examples with my dog.  My dog, Coco has always been a sad one, but I've found ways to bond with him by taking him to the park, feeding him, and playing with him. I've also let him sleep in my room and listen music with him.  Dogs love it when you can just sit down and listen to music with them, it builds that alone time relationship with just you and your dog while doing <em>absolutley nothing.</em></p>

          <p>Another thing to do with your dog is to take him out to dog parks, they love it when they can socialize with other animals when you're around. A list of dog parks will be shown below.</p>
